### Hail 🪁

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in Applied Mathematics.  
I work on problems using deep learning, optimization, and signal processing. I use both data and models to build smart systems.

🧠 Interests:
- Robust learning with noisy, imbalanced, or incomplete data
- Deep CNNs and self-supervised learning
- Optimization and mathematical modeling
- Signal processing (radar and acoustic signals) and time-series analysis 
- Scalable ML for real-world systems and edge deployment
- Game theory for strategic interactions, auctions, and resource allocation
